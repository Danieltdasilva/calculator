As I'm on my learning journey with programming, what a better way to learn than building a calculator? (plus I lost my college calculator, so I needed one).

I built the calculator using mainly HTML and CSS to style it. I added the JavaScript code directly inside the HTML, since it wouldn't be tons of code.<br>
I did a nice blue background, and a dark calculator (wouldn't want to hurt my eyes at night).<br>
